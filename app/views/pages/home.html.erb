This is a main page

Users

There are 3 types of users:
- Admin
- Publisher
- User

Admin users can:
- add/remove/edit other users.
- add/remove/edit any area in the CMS

Publisher users can:
- add/edit any Post in the CMS

User
- the regular user doesn’t have access to CMS
- user can access the website

Each user should have a User ID per registration that will be used for Email topics when the user sends some questions (see description below)
Sign Up flow

Admin user creates a new user and sets user’s email address + user role (any of 3)
After submitting the creation, the user should get an email with the invitation link.

When a user clicks on the link, we navigate s/him to the Sign Up page with the form.
Form fields are all required.
First Name
Last Name
Company (dropdown with preset values from CMS)
Create Password
Confirm Password

After login, all users are redirected to the Homepage of the website.

Notifications
There are 2 types of notifications:
First-time users always see the first notification that leads them to the Onboarding Post page.
If any new page was added, users will be notified. If any Post, Category, Sub-Category was edited - users will be notified. We should add a checkbox “Notify all users about this change”. By default, it should be checked. An editor will see a popup before saving that will result in notifying all the users about the change. We do this to avoid sending notifications if the editor fixed some typos, etc.
Notification will be active unless the user hits it and checks the update.

The notifications that the user has already checked should be shown in the notification drop down during the current session only. Unseen notifications shouldn’t be dependent on the session.


Contactor button in the header
This button is a simple “mailto” that will open an email program and allow the user to send an email.
When the user opens the email program, we should prefill:
- Topic: Should be the user ID

User icon in the header

Dropdown menu that will contain only one option: “Log out”


User session
Since the website will be used by the transport clerks, we should set a session time to 24 hours. After that, the user should be logged out.

Search
This is the main feature of the website.
Probably we should use ES.
The search should give users search hints on typing.
Search areas: post titles, post body text, file names
Search should give results by relevance

Homepage
Admin users should be able to select categories to be shown on the Homepage. They are the featured categories among others.

Categories on the homepage can have 3 templates:
- Category name + Images + subcategories + post pages lists (we show 5 posts from the sub-category + more link)
- Category name + Sub-categories + posts
- Category name + Posts

Admin users can add any quantity of categories to the Homepage (1-max existing in DB)

There should be a sorting option for the Categories on the Homepage.
Sorting for inner items (subs and posts) should be the same as we have on Subs pages.
